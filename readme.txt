Required installs:
numpy, tensorflow, keras, sklearn

How to run:
Running the cnn.py file will download the database and train the network, and then test the accuracy.

After the network is done training and testing, it will print a line stating the accuracy.

To speed up the training and testing, you can modify lines 19 and 20. Setting both variables to 2 will give the most significant speedup and will not affect accuracy much.
